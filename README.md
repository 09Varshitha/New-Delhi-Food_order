📊 Food Delivery Data Analysis Project – New Delhi 🛵🍴
 Using Python for Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
Over the past few days, I’ve been exploring a dataset of food delivery orders from New Delhi, and I’m excited to share some insights from my analysis! This was a hands-on project focused on uncovering customer behavior, order trends, and business patterns in the online food delivery space.
🔍 Project Objectives:
Understand peak ordering days and times
Identify popular payment methods
Analyze order value distribution and pricing trends
Investigate refunds/chargebacks and delivery fees
Visualize correlations between different numerical variables
🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used:
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Data Cleaning, Handling Missing Values
Feature Engineering (e.g., extracting weekdays from timestamps)
📌 Insights & Visualizations Created:
1️⃣ Bar Chart: Orders by Day of the Week – Showed high order volumes on weekends
 2️⃣ Pie Chart: Payment Method Distribution – Highlighted the most preferred payment modes
 3️⃣ Histogram: Order Value Distribution – Gave a view of customer spending behavior
 4️⃣ Scatter Plot: Relationship between Order Value and Delivery Fee
 5️⃣ Donut Chart: Refunds or Chargebacks – Measured customer dissatisfaction
 6️⃣ Line Plot: Average Order Value Over Time – Uncovered seasonal or promotional patterns
 7️⃣ Box Plot: Compared Order Values by Payment Method
 8️⃣ Heatmap: Correlation among numerical features for deeper analysis
⚙️ Data Cleaning Highlights:
Filled missing categorical values using mode
Parsed datetime fields and extracted day-of-week features
Handled non-numeric values and filtered out erroneous timestamps
💡 Business Value:
Delivery platforms can use these insights to optimize delivery staff allocation on peak days
Marketing teams can design targeted offers for underperforming days
Refund analysis helps improve customer service and retention strategies
Understanding payment preferences can guide fintech integrations
📈 What I Learned:
Real-world data is messy — cleaning is half the battle
Visual storytelling is powerful in surfacing actionable insights
Simple charts can answer big questions when used effectively
Domain knowledge makes analysis more meaningful
👨‍💻 Always looking to grow in the field of data analytics and visualization. Would love to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, food-tech professionals, and mentors in this space!
